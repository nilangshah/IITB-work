\section{Introduction}

Current architectures and compilers continue to evolve
bringing higher performance, lower power and smaller
size while attempting to keep time to market as short as
possible.\cite{Plug} Typical systems may now have multiple het-
erogeneous reconfigurable cores and a great number of
compiler optimizations available, making manual com-
piler tuning increasingly infeasible. Furthermore, static
compilers often fail to produce high-quality code due to
a simplistic model of the underlying hardware.\\

A key goal of the project is to make machine learning
based compilation a realistic technology for general-
purpose compilation. Current approaches 
are highly preliminary limited to global compiler
flags or simple transformations considered in isolation.
GCC was selected as the compiler infrastructure for
MILEPOST as it is currently the most stable and ro-
bust open-source compiler.\cite{Qlogic} It supports multiple archi-
tectures and has multiple aggressive optimizations mak-
ing it a natural vehicle for our research. In addition,
each new version usually features new transformations
demonstrating the need for a system to automatically re-
tune its optimization heuristics.
